- The name of the subway route with the most stops as well as a count of its stops
- The name of the subway route with the fewest stops as well as a count of its stops
- A list of the stops that connect two or more subway routes along with the relevant
route names for each of those stops.
- Given 2 stops (provided by a user), a list of the rail routes you would travel to get from one stop to the other
